FastJ 1.5.1 has been released, with 80 new commits since FastJ [1.5.0][FastJ-Version-1.5.0-Release-Link]. This version of FastJ contains bug fixes, new features, new examples, and more! Read on to find out what's new.

## New Example Programs
2 new example programs have been added to FastJ: Simple Audio and Behaviors! Check them out below:

- [FastJ Audio](http://examples.fastj.me/audio/Main.java) -- Simple Audio Playing/Loading in FastJ
- [Behaviors](http://examples.fastj.me/behaviors/Main.java) -- Behaviors in FastJ


## Replace Issue Templates with Issue Forms
All of FastJ's issue templates have been replaced with GitHub's [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms). [Check them out here](https://github.com/fastjengine/FastJ/issues/new/choose)!


## Audio from Java URLs
Loading/Playing Audio with FastJ can now be done using `java.net.URL`, enabling easy use of sound files contained in a jarfile through the `ClassLoader`.


## Added Missing Keyboard Improvements Section to 1.5.0
It seems that I forgot to cover the improvements made to FastJ's keyboard system in the 1.5.0 release. Sorry! [Go check it out to see what's up](https://fastj.tech/news/2021/08/04/fastj-1-5-0-release#keyboard-improvements).


## General Changelog

### Additions
- Added explicit methods to manage behaviors/keys pressed in `LogicManager`
- `initBehaviors` -- requests that the `LogicManager` initialize its behaviors
- `updateBehaviors` -- requests that the `LogicManager` update its behaviors
- `processKeysDown` -- requests that the `LogicManager` process keys pressed down
- `BehaviorManager.destroyListenerList` for destroying the behaviors of any `BehaviorHandler`'s behavior listener list
- `BehaviorHandler.destroyBehaviorListeners` for calling the `BehaviorManager`'s behavior destroying method


### Breaking Changes
- (by [@Sammie156][Sammie156-Link], PR [#72][FastJ-Pull-72]) Renamed `SupportedFileFormats` to [`SupportedModelFormats`](https://github.com/fastjengine/FastJ/blob/main/src/main/java/tech/fastj/graphics/io/SupportedModelFormats.java)
- `SceneManager` no longer handles input at the update() stage. All input dealt with in `SceneManager` will be called _before_ `render()`
- `SceneManager` behavior initialization now occurs after background adjustments and scene initialization


### Bug Fixes
- ([#96][FastJ-Issue-96]) Fixed issue where `LogicManager` did not initialize, update, or destroy behaviors
- Fixed issue where `LogicManager` did not act on keys pressed down
- ([#99][FastJ-Issue-99]) Added behavior destroy calls to both `SimpleManager` and `Scene` classes' `reset` methods


### Other Changes
- (by [@SaadRehmanCS][SaadRehmanCS-Link], PR [#71][FastJ-Pull-71]) include default case in `AudioEventListener.AudioEventProcessor` switch statements which throws `IllegalStateException`
- (by [@Sammie156][Sammie156-Link], PR [#80][FastJ-Pull-80]) removed unnecessary casts in `Gradient.java` and `Point.java`
- (by [@Sammie156][Sammie156-Link], PR [#84][FastJ-Pull-84]) removed more unnecessary casts in `Point.java` and `MemoryAudioPlayer.java`
- (internal) Replaced `update/init/renderCurrentScene` methods with `safeUpdate/Init/Render` methods, respectively
- (internal) Reorganize unit tests to match main package structure
- (internal) Added unit tests to cover loading/playing audio with URLs
- (internal) Added unit tests to cover unloading multiple audio files at once
